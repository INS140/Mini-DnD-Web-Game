# Mini-DnD-Web-Game

## Summary
This is a D&D based web game that I have created for the bootcamp I am enrolled in through Thrive DX. This project is a combat simulator with three levels, each harder than the last to complete. In each level, a random set of monsters appear with similar stats to that of their originals in the D&D Monster Manual. The player of the game will win if they can defeat the boss in the final level.
